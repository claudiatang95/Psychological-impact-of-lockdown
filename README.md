# Psychological-impact-of-lockdown
## Introduction
This project partially replicated the study of Brodeur et al. (2020), who tested whether the introduction of partial or full lockdowns produced an increase in 13 well-being related Google topic searches that served as a proxy for peopleâ€™s mental health status. 
We used data referring to Italy, Germany and the UK, over a time period that goes from January 1st 2020 to March 22nd, 2020. The time frame is chosen to span from the beginning of the year to the moment in which Germany and the UK, which are the control groups, introduced some form of lockdown due to the Covid Pandemic. Italy, which implemented a full lockdown on March 9th 2020, is the treatment group.
